# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Training machine learning models to predict heart disease using patient data.

## Objective
The three machine learning algorithms that were used are:
1. K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
2. Decision Tree
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
 
The main objective is to predict the likelihood of patients with heart disease based on their medical information and risk factors. Suspected patients are classified as '1' and not suspected patients are classified as '0'.

## Result
The champion model is K-Nearest Neighbour machine learning model using univariate selection with parameter tuning. It achieved an F1 score of **90.91%**.

## Key Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training (KNN, Decision Tree, SVM)
- Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion matrix)

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy
